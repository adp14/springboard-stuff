##Loan Project##

The goal of this project is to identify the factors most closely tied to the borrowersâ€™ risk of default and to determine if other variables such as occupation, purpose of the loan, loan duration and loan amount effect the expected performance of the loan.


###The Problem###

When lenders assess which loan applications, many factors go into the underwriting.  The obvious factors of credit score and income have been well studied, but there are many other factors that can be considered.  Identifying other predictive indicators can allow lenders to make loans to potential borrowers that may not have the most traditional risk assessment profile and also to identify potential borrowers that may be riskier then they appear at first glance.  

Borrowers in underserved communities do not always have a traditional credit profile and are therefore subject to higher interest rates, a more torturous underwriting process, or even outright rejection of otherwise qualified borrowers.  Having other risk factors to weigh may help borrowers in these locations more easily obtain loans or receive more favorable terms.

####Client###

The intended client would be smaller lenders that are interested in expanding their risk assessment into using less traditional methods of underwriting methods. 

###Data###

The data has been provided by lendingclub.com and includes a listing of all of their loans and their performance since 2004 consisting of well over 100,000 loans
